Personal initialization config for linux systems 
Requires apt as package manager 
 
Actually I have only tested it on ubuntu and kali... 
That's why is only personal lol 
 
You say, why do you need such a stuff?
Well, I somehow changes my hdd and systems a bit more often than I expected 
Idk why, but after that, I think I need a portable init config lol 
Really dislike repeating setup after installing a new linux system...
